Disadvantages of Python are:

Speed

Python is slower than C or C++. But of course, Python is a high-level language, unlike C or C++ it's not closer to hardware.

Mobile Development

Python is not a very good language for mobile development . It is seen as a weak language for mobile computing. This is the reason very few mobile applications are built in it like Carbonnelle.

Memory Consumption

Python is not a good choice for memory intensive tasks. Due to the flexibility of the data-types, Python's memory consumption is also high.
